## Loops

Now Melissa knows how to shoot the virtual trebuchet and get the distance of the projectile, but in order to aim she needs to make a lot of trial shots in a row.
She wants her trebuchet to only shoot a hundred meters.

She could execute the function several times on the REPL with different parameters, but that gets tiresome quickly.
A better way to do this is to use loops.

But first Melissa needs a way to improve her parameters.

> ## Digression: gradients
> The `shoot_distance` function takes three input parameters and returns one value (the distance).
> Whenever we change one of the input parameters, we will get a different distance.
>

> 
> Since the `shoot_distance` function has three input parameters, the gradient of `shoot_distance` will return a 3-element `Array`.
> One direction for each input parameter.

> Thanks to [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) and the julia package `ForwardDiff.jl` gradients can be calculated easily.

Melissa uses the `gradient` function of `ForwardDiff.jl` to get the direction in which she needs to change the parameters to make the largest difference.

Since she can't influence the wind, the only arguments that can vary are the release angle and the mass of the counterweight.
~~~
julia> using ForwardDiff: gradient

julia> arguments = [0.25pi, 500];

julia> grad = gradient(x -> (shoot_distance([5, x...]) - 100), arguments)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 -47.1917378801788
  -0.022101014146311698
~~~
{: .language-julia}

Melissa now changes her arguments a little bit in the direction of the gradient and checks the new distance.

~~~
julia> new_arguments = arguments - 0.05 * grad;

julia> shoot_distance([5, new_arguments...])
58.871526223121755
~~~
{: .language-julia}

That got shorter, but also a bit too short.

> ## Experiment
> How far can you change the parameters in the direction of the gradient, such that it still improves the distance?

### For loops

Now that Melissa knows it is going in the right direction she wants to automate the additional iterations.
She writes a new function `aim`, that performs the application of the gradient `N` times.
~~~
julia> function aim(target, arguments; N = 10, η = 0.05, wind::Float64 = 5.0)
           new_arguments = copy(arguments)
           for _ in 1:N
               grad = gradient(x -> (shoot_distance([wind, x...]) - target), new_arguments)
               new_arguments -= η * grad
               # short form of `new_arguments = new_arguments - η * grad`
           end
           return new_arguments
       end

julia> new_arguments = aim(100, arguments);

julia> shoot_distance([5, new_arguments...])
92.90796744088856
~~~
{: .language-julia}

> ## Explore
> Play around with different inputs of `N` and `η`.
> How close can you come?

### While loops

Melissa finds the output of the above `aim` function too unpredictable to be useful.
That's why she decides to change it a bit.
This time she uses a `while`-loop to run the iterations until she is sufficiently near her target.

~~~
julia> function aim(target, arguments; ε = 1e-1, η = 0.05, wind::Float64 = 5.0)
           new_arguments = copy(arguments)
           hit = x -> (shoot_distance([wind, x...]) - target)
           while abs(hit(new_arguments)) > ε
               grad = gradient(hit, new_arguments)
               new_arguments -= η * grad
           end
           return new_arguments
       end

julia> aim(100, arguments)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 119.59293257732767
 499.9498970976752

julia> shoot_distance([5, ans...])
100.0975848073789
~~~
{: .language-julia}

That is more what she had in mind.
